              I decided to make the career change to become a web developer in order to push myself and give 
              myself the creativity to build amazing things using only my two hands and a computer. 
              Since a young age, I had always enjoyed the aspect of coding and technology in general, 
              so after some deliberation and discussion with my friends in the industry, I decided to finally 
              make the jump into coding by joining General Assembly, and I couldn’t be happier.
