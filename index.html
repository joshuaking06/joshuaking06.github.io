              I decided to make the career change to become a web developer in order to push myself and give 
              myself the creativity to build amazing things using only my two hands and a computer. 
              Since a young age, I had always enjoyed the aspect of coding and technology in general, 
              so after some deliberation and discussion with my friends in the industry, I decided to finally 
              make the jump into coding by joining General Assembly, and I couldnâ€™t be happier. 

              I have have really enjoyed the challenges and wins that coding has already provided me, 
              and I eagerly await the next ones. I am looking forward to beginning my career as a developer 
              in an environment that not only is full of friendly people, but also gives me a great opportunity 
              to solve challenging problems with others, learn new technology and methods, and also to 
              become a more accomplished developer.
